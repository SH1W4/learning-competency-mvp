# Alignment Audit — LASTRO

**Status:** active alignment control  
**Track:** Learning Competency  
**Date:** 2026-10-04  
**Baseline:** existing MVP architecture and current documentation set

## 1. Purpose

This document records the cross-layer alignment audit of the LASTRO project.

The audit verifies whether research, research decisions, architecture, implementation, product documentation, frontend specification, evaluation claims, demo proof, and submission narrative describe the **same system at the same level of maturity**.

This is a control artifact. It is not a new architecture, product roadmap, market-validation report, pitch, or request to expand the MVP.

The central rule is:

> **The existing MVP architecture is the baseline. Documentation and product narrative must align to it; research must not force architectural expansion without a separate decision.**

## 2. Audit principle

~~~

The chain must not be read backwards.

> **The existence of an implemented MVP does not prove market demand, commercial viability, or the truth of broader research hypotheses.**

A research hypothesis must not become an implemented capability merely because it appears repeatedly in product narratives or mockups.

## 3. Canonical MVP architecture

The current MVP architecture remains unchanged.

The canonical technical wedge is:

~~~text
Evidence
   ↓
Independent Verification
   ↓
Consensus
   ↓
Competency State
   ↓
Attestation
   ↓
Public Verification
~~~

The shorter product shorthand, Evidence → Competency → Verification → State → Attestation → Verification, may be used in pitch/product communication, but must not replace the detailed architectural representation.

## 4. Canonical domain boundaries

### 4.1 Evidence

Evidence represents an observable artifact, activity output, or record.

Evidence must remain distinguishable from interpretation, competency state, verification result, and attestation. Evidence retains provenance and origin.

### 4.2 Interpretation

AI may organize evidence, identify relationships, map evidence to criteria, detect inconsistencies, propose classifications, identify evidence gaps, and request additional evidence.

AI interpretation is not final competency authority.

### 4.3 Independent verification

Verification mechanisms must remain meaningfully distinguishable.

The deterministic verifier must operate directly on explicit competency criteria, activities, eligible evidence, and related domain contracts.

It must not silently consume AI confidence, AI classification, or AI-generated relation signals as its authority.

### 4.4 Governance / Compliance

Governance defines the conditions under which verification results may produce a state transition.

Relevant context can include eligibility, reviewer role, independence, conflicts of interest, escalation rules, policy version, and additional review requirements.

Governance is not itself the competency state.

### 4.5 Consensus

Consensus is the convergence layer between verification results and state transition.

Consensus is not simple vote counting.

Canonical consensus outcomes are:

~~~text
AGREEMENT
INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE
CONFLICT
HUMAN_ADJUDICATION
~~~

The competency state must not advance while the case is materially insufficient or conflicted.

### 4.6 Human Review vs. Human Adjudication

These concepts must remain separate.

**Human Review** is a normal review step used to inspect interpreted evidence, criteria, provenance, or verification context.

**Human Adjudication** is an exception path used when verification mechanisms conflict, evidence remains materially ambiguous, contextual judgment is required, an existing rule does not adequately cover the case, or a contestation requires resolution.

~~~text
NORMAL REVIEW
AI / evidence interpretation
        ↓
HUMAN REVIEW
        ↓
verification / governance
~~~

is distinct from:

~~~text
CONFLICT / EXCEPTION
        ↓
HUMAN ADJUDICATION
        ↓
RESOLUTION
~~~

No document should use the terms as interchangeable labels.

### 4.7 Competency State

The state represents only what the available evidence, verification results, and governance rules support.

A competency state is not a universal measure of human ability, a truth score, a hiring decision, a ranking, or a measure of human worth.

### 4.8 Attestation

Attestation represents a defined state or event.

It is an output of the verification/governance process, not the primary product object.

Sensitive evidence remains off-chain.

Solana is used as an integrity anchor and does not determine whether a person is competent.

## 5. Research alignment

### 5.1 Market validation

research/04_MARKET_VALIDATION_EVIDENCE.md remains a separate evidence track.

It may support existence of broad workforce/skills pressures, material relevance of changing work and skills gaps, and the need for further customer validation.

It does not, by itself, establish a definitive buyer, willingness to pay, pricing, recurring adoption, product-market fit, or superiority over alternatives.

**Audit result: ALIGNED.**

No architectural change is justified by the current market evidence.

### 5.2 Colosseum ecosystem benchmark

research/05_COLOSSEUM_ECOSYSTEM_BENCHMARK.md establishes an adjacent ecosystem landscape.

The benchmark identifies projects involving credentials, verified professionals, profiles, skills, talent matching, achievements, and performance verification.

The benchmark does not justify the claim that nobody has attempted competency verification.

The defensible research finding remains:

> The reviewed public material contains adjacent solutions, while the complete combination of evidence of work → independent verification → consensus → competency state → attestation was not identified in the public descriptions reviewed.

**Audit result: ALIGNED.**

The finding remains a differentiation hypothesis rather than a proof of market uniqueness.

### 5.3 Research decisions

research/06_DECISIONS.md is aligned with the current architecture.

D-001 preserves evidence / competency separation; D-002 establishes evidence-backed competency as the research wedge; D-004 keeps the complete trust pipeline as a differentiation hypothesis; D-006 keeps Dynamic Role Architecture as research; D-007 keeps the MVP technically bounded; D-008 prevents AI from becoming competency authority; D-009 preserves independent verification; D-010 preserves human adjudication; D-011 keeps sensitive evidence off-chain; D-012 treats attestation as output; D-013 keeps frontend downstream of the domain model.

**Audit result: ALIGNED.**

## 6. Research extension boundary

Dynamic Role Architecture remains outside the current MVP.

Research chain:

~~~text
Work Change
   ↓
Role Delta
   ↓
Competency Gap
   ↓
Requalification
   ↓
Proof of Competency
~~~

Current MVP:

~~~text
Evidence
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Consensus
   ↓
Competency State
   ↓
Attestation
~~~

DRA must build above the existing competency/proof foundation rather than modify its trust boundary.

**Audit result: ALIGNED.**

No DRA capability should be presented as implemented unless it exists in the implementation, its architecture is explicitly adopted, its evidence requirements are defined, and its claims are separately validated.

## 7. Product alignment

The broader product thesis, “Transform changing work into evidence-based competency intelligence, requalification pathways, and verifiable competency states,” is a strategic product thesis.

The narrower implemented product is:

> Evidence-backed competency.

The MVP proves the narrower wedge.

**Audit result: ALIGNED, WITH NARRATIVE BOUNDARY.**

The broader thesis must continue to be labeled as strategic/research direction where it exceeds the implemented MVP.

The current product object is the relationship between evidence, competency criterion, verification mechanisms, resulting bounded state, provenance, and integrity reference.

It is not simply a certificate, profile, credential, talent score, or NFT.

## 8. Frontend alignment

The frontend specification correctly defines the frontend as a projection of the domain model.

The frontend must not invent competency rules, calculate an independent competency state, manufacture verification results, reproduce Consensus Core logic, or imply backend capabilities that do not exist.

### Two narrative layers

**MVP / demonstrable layer**

~~~text
Evidence
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Consensus
   ↓
Competency State
   ↓
Proof
~~~

**Strategic / research layer**

~~~text
Work Change
   ↓
Role Delta
   ↓
Competency Gap
   ↓
Requalification
~~~

The strategic layer may explain the larger product direction, but must not visually imply that corresponding backend capabilities are already validated or fully implemented.

**Audit result: ALIGNED WITH REQUIRED PRESENTATION CONTROL.**

## 9. Consensus vocabulary alignment

A material documentation inconsistency was identified between the Consensus Core and Governance/Compliance documents.

Some documents mix consensus outcomes with operational process states.

### Canonical consensus outcomes

~~~text
AGREEMENT
INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE
CONFLICT
HUMAN_ADJUDICATION
~~~

### Process / governance states

If needed, operational states such as:

~~~text
PENDING_REVIEW
ADJUDICATED
~~~

may exist separately.

They must not be presented as interchangeable with Consensus Core outcomes.

**Required correction:** review docs/architecture/CONSENSUS_CORE.md, docs/architecture/GOVERNANCE_COMPLIANCE_LAYER.md, docs/evaluation/03_VERIFICATION_AND_GOVERNANCE.md, and frontend state documentation.

**Acceptance criterion:** a reader must be able to distinguish what the verification mechanisms concluded from what the operational state of the review process is.

**Status: OPEN — DOCUMENTATION CORRECTION REQUIRED.**

## 10. Evidence / review alignment

The MVP documentation correctly separates evidence from interpretation.

~~~text
SOURCE EVIDENCE
      ↓
EXTRACTION
      ↓
INTERPRETATION
      ↓
REVIEW / VERIFICATION
      ↓
CONSENSUS
      ↓
STATE
~~~

No layer may silently overwrite the provenance of the previous layer.

For every demonstrated state, the documentation and implementation should make it possible to answer:

1. What evidence existed?
2. What interpretation was produced?
3. Which verification mechanisms were applied?
4. What criteria were evaluated?
5. What governance conditions applied?
6. What consensus outcome occurred?
7. Why did the state transition?
8. What record was attested?
9. How can the integrity reference be verified?

**Status: ALIGNED.**

## 11. Attestation alignment

Current model:

~~~text
Competency State
      ↓
Deterministic Record
      ↓
Attestation
      ↓
Public Integrity Verification
~~~

The current m3.attestation.v2 implementation is complete as an M3 capability.

The current public Devnet transaction remains an M4 closing artifact.

No historical transaction should be presented as the current public proof.

The current m3.attestation.v2 transaction must be generated and verified before being registered as the current demo proof.

**Status: ALIGNED. M4 ACTION REMAINS OPEN.**

## 12. Demo alignment

Canonical technical demo:

~~~text

   ↓
Activities
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
AI Interpretation
   ↓
Independent Verification
   ↓
Consensus
   ↓
DEMONSTRATED
   ↓
Attestation
   ↓
Public Verification
~~~

The demo uses synthetic data.

Synthetic data must never be represented as customer evidence, pilot evidence, traction, or market validation.

**Status: ALIGNED.**

## 13. Claim alignment

The project can currently claim that the MVP demonstrates:

- structured evidence;
- provenance-aware processing;
- AI-assisted interpretation;
- deterministic verification independent of AI signals;
- bounded competency states;
- human adjudication only when required by unresolved conflict, ambiguity, contestation, or unsupported context;
- consensus handling for covered scenarios;
- conflict and insufficient-evidence handling;
- deterministic record hashing;
- Solana Devnet integrity anchoring capability;
- public verification when a current Devnet transaction is available.

The project cannot currently claim:

- universal competency assessment;
- absence of bias;
- elimination of human judgment;
- blockchain proving truth or merit;
- autonomous hiring/firing;
- definitive buyer;
- willingness to pay;
- validated pricing;
- recurring commercial adoption;
- proven economic impact;
- universal suitability of automated competency assessment.

**Status: ALIGNED.**

Market validation and ecosystem research are parallel evidence tracks, not a causal sequence.

## 16. Required corrections

### A-001 — Normalize Consensus vocabulary

**Priority:** P0

Separate Consensus outcomes from Governance/process states.

**Affected documents:**

- docs/architecture/CONSENSUS_CORE.md
- docs/architecture/GOVERNANCE_COMPLIANCE_LAYER.md
- docs/evaluation/03_VERIFICATION_AND_GOVERNANCE.md
- frontend specification where applicable

**Acceptance:** no document uses CONFLICTED, PENDING_REVIEW, or ADJUDICATED as interchangeable replacements for canonical Consensus outcomes.

### A-002 — Keep Human Adjudication as the only human exception path

**Priority:** P0

Remove Human Review as a normal pipeline stage. Preserve Human Adjudication only as an exception path for unresolved conflict, ambiguity, contestation or unsupported context.

**Acceptance:** no canonical MVP flow requires a human reviewer before Consensus Core; Human Adjudication appears only as an exception.

### A-003 — Correct research dependency map

**Priority:** P1

Update the research decision dependency map so Market Validation and Colosseum Benchmark are parallel evidence tracks feeding Research Decisions.

**Acceptance:**

### A-004 — Mark strategic frontend screens explicitly

**Priority:** P1

Ensure Work Change, Role Delta, Competency Gap and Requalification are visibly identified as strategic/research narrative where they exceed the implemented MVP.

**Acceptance:** a juror cannot reasonably interpret these screens as proof of implemented organizational intelligence.

### A-005 — Preserve canonical architecture

**Priority:** P0 / permanent

No documentation correction may introduce a new backend layer or alter the current MVP trust boundary unless a separate architectural decision is recorded.

**Acceptance:** all product/documentation changes remain projections of the existing architecture.

### A-006 — Close current Devnet proof

**Priority:** P0 / M4

Generate, verify and register the current m3.attestation.v2 Devnet transaction.

**Acceptance:** docs/evaluation/04_DEMO_AND_PROOF.md and README reference the current verified proof only.

## 17. Non-actions

The audit explicitly authorizes **no** architectural expansion for:

- Dynamic Role Architecture;
- universal competency taxonomy;
- full LMS;
- recruiting marketplace;
- multi-organization infrastructure;
- tokenomics;
- sensitive on-chain evidence;
- universal automated assessment;
- new consensus mechanisms solely for narrative completeness.

These remain research or future product questions.

## 18. Definition of Alignment

The project is considered aligned when:

### Research

- observed evidence, interpretation, hypothesis and decision remain distinguishable;
- market evidence is not confused with customer validation;
- ecosystem overlap is not confused with architectural equivalence.

### Architecture

- one canonical MVP pipeline exists;
- evidence remains distinct from interpretation and state;
- verification mechanisms remain independent where required;
- Consensus Core remains the convergence layer;
- governance remains explicit;
- attestation remains an output.

### Product

- the MVP wedge is clear;
- broader product vision is clearly bounded as strategic/research;
- the product object is competency state backed by evidence and provenance.

### Frontend

- UI projects domain state;
- UI does not create domain decisions;
- strategic research flows are clearly separated from demonstrated capabilities.

### Evaluation

- claims match implementation;
- claims match available proof;
- synthetic demo data is not presented as market evidence;
- current public Devnet proof is used.

### Submission

- demo, pitch, repository and public proof tell the same story.

## 19. Final audit conclusion

The current audit does **not** identify a need to redesign or expand the MVP architecture.

The architecture is sufficiently consolidated to serve as the project's technical baseline.

The principal work now is alignment, not invention:

DECISIONS

The governing principle for the next phase is:

> **Do not make the architecture fit the narrative. Make the narrative accurately expose the architecture.**
