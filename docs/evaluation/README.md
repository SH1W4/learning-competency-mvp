# LASTRO — Evaluation Documentation

**LASTRO** is the product identity. **Learning Competency** is the technical domain and repository context. This directory contains the English-language documentation intended for external evaluation, hackathon reviewers, technical reviewers, and other readers who need a concise understanding of the project.

The Portuguese documentation remains the team's primary working documentation. This evaluation layer is deliberately smaller: it explains the product, architecture, verification model, demonstration path, and current limitations without exposing internal operating material.

2. [Architecture & Evidence Pipeline](02_ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. [Consensus, Governance & Attestation](03_VERIFICATION_AND_GOVERNANCE.md)

5. [Limitations & Claims](05_LIMITATIONS_AND_CLAIMS.md)

## One-line thesis

> **We turn changing work into evidence-based competency intelligence, requalification pathways, and verifiable competency states.**

## Current MVP wedge

```
Evidence → Competency → Verification → State → Attestation → Verification
```

The MVP proves a narrower claim before expanding toward organizational intelligence:

```
Evidence
  ↓
Independent verification
  ↓
Consensus
  ↓
Competency state
  ↓
Attestation
  ↓
Public verification
```

## Current implementation status

The repository contains a working M1→M3 vertical slice covering:

- structured evidence ingestion;
- evidence extraction and provenance;
- AI-assisted interpretation;
- deterministic criteria checks independent from AI signals;
- human review;
- Consensus Core for covered convergent cases;
- competency state transitions;
- attestation on Solana Devnet;
- integrity and payload-binding verification;
- automated tests and type checking.

Market validation, pricing, recurring commercial adoption, and the broader Dynamic Role Architecture remain hypotheses under validation.

## Important distinction

This documentation describes what the current MVP implements and what remains a hypothesis. It does not present synthetic demonstration data as customer evidence or claim that blockchain independently proves competency.
