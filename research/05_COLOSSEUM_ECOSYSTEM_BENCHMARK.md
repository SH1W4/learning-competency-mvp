# Colosseum Ecosystem Benchmark

**Status:** research / ecosystem benchmark  
**Track:** Learning Competency  
**Date:** 2026-10-04  
**Scope:** Public Colosseum hackathon ecosystem  
**Verification pass:** 2026-10-04  
**Research question:** Has the Colosseum ecosystem already produced a project substantially similar to LASTRO?

---

## 1. Purpose

This document records a focused ecosystem benchmark requested during the research phase.

It has one purpose:

> **Identify existing Colosseum projects that overlap with the problem space of credentials, skills, competency, evidence, verification, talent or professional reputation, and determine how closely they overlap with the current LASTRO model.**

This document records research findings. It does not define product strategy, pitch language, market validation or implementation decisions.

---

## 2. Research baseline

The original Phase #0 research library identified a fragmented evidence/trust problem and distinguished:

1. self-declaration;
2. evidence presented;
3. evidence analyzed;
4. source verified.

It also established that hypotheses must not become facts through repetition.

Source:

- `research/00_ORIGIN/O_JOGO_QUE_ESTAMOS_JOGANDO_FASE_0_v0.1.md`

This benchmark extends that research by checking the Colosseum ecosystem for prior or adjacent attempts.

---

## 3. Research questions

### Primary

> **Has Colosseum already seen a project that turns evidence of work into a verifiable competency state through independent verification and consensus?**

### Secondary

- Are credentials already being verified?
- Are skills or professional capabilities already being verified?
- Are achievements or performance already being recorded as verifiable proof?
- Are verified-talent systems already present?
- Are AI systems already matching people based on skills and experience?
- Does an existing project use **competency state** as its primary object?
- Does an existing project explicitly combine **evidence → independent verification → consensus → competency state → attestation**?

---

## 4. Scope and method

The scan focused on publicly accessible Colosseum material, especially:

- the Colosseum project directory;
- individual project pages;
- historical hackathon project references.

Search terms were expanded beyond "competency" to include:

- skills;
- credentials;
- certificates;
- verification;
- talent;
- hiring;
- resume / CV;
- achievements;
- learning;
- performance;
- attestation;
- reputation;
- professional identity.

### Evidence standard

Each candidate is evaluated against the same dimensions:

| Dimension | Question |
|---|---|
| Primary object | What does the project actually represent or decide? |
| Evidence | Is observable work or source evidence central to the model? |
| Verification | Is verification explicit, and what is being verified? |
| Independence | Are verification mechanisms independent of the originating interpretation? |
| Consensus | Does the system reconcile multiple signals or verification mechanisms? |
| Competency state | Is capability represented as an explicit bounded state? |
| Attestation | Is the resulting state or claim independently attestable/verifiable? |

Classification is based on the **public project description**, not on assumptions about hidden implementation. A missing feature is therefore recorded as **not established**, rather than as proof that the feature does not exist.

### Limitation

This is a **public ecosystem scan**.

Absence from the reviewed public material does not prove that no related private, unpublished or poorly indexed project exists.

Therefore the valid conclusion is:

> **No project was identified in the public Colosseum material reviewed that explicitly describes the complete LASTRO evidence → independent verification → consensus → competency state → attestation workflow.**

It would be incorrect to conclude that nobody in the ecosystem is working on competency verification.

---

## 5. Reference model for comparison

The current LASTRO technical wedge used for comparison is:

```
WORK
  ↓
EVIDENCE
  ↓
INTERPRETATION
  ↓
INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION
  ↓
CONSENSUS
  ↓
COMPETENCY STATE
  ↓
ATTESTATION
  ↓
PUBLIC VERIFICATION
```

The primary object being investigated is therefore a **competency state backed by evidence**, rather than a certificate, profile, achievement or candidate record.

# 8. Findings

## 8.1 Components already exist

The scan confirms that the Colosseum ecosystem has already explored:

- credential verification;
- professional verification;
- verified talent;
- skills and experience;
- AI-assisted talent matching;
- achievements;
- learning credentials;
- domain-specific performance verification;
- on-chain professional records.

Therefore these primitives should not be presented as individually novel.

## 8.2 The complete workflow was not identified

Within the public material reviewed, no project was identified that explicitly describes the complete combination:

```
Evidence of work
      ↓
Competency criteria
      ↓
Independent verification mechanisms
      ↓
Consensus
      ↓
Competency state
      ↓
Attestation
```

The important finding is therefore not:

> "Nobody has built this."

It is:

> **The reviewed ecosystem contains several adjacent pieces, but the complete evidence-to-competency trust workflow was not identified in the public project descriptions reviewed.**

## 8.3 Primary object differs

The projects reviewed generally center on:

- certificate;
- professional;
- profile;
- candidate;
- achievement;
- domain-specific performance.

LASTRO centers its current research model on:

> **competency state backed by evidence.**

This is the main architectural distinction identified by the benchmark.

# 9. Direct vs adjacent overlap

| Dimension | Existing ecosystem examples | LASTRO research model |
|---|---|---|
| Credential | LearnProof | Not the primary object |
| Professional profile | Solana Matcher / VeriCred | Derived context |
| Verified talent | VeriCred | Potential downstream use |
| Skills matching | Solana Matcher | Not the core |
| Achievement | Strikesense | Evidence may support state |
| Evidence of work | Not clearly central in reviewed descriptions | Central |
| Independent verification | Not clearly described as multiple mechanisms | Central |
| Consensus | Not identified in reviewed descriptions | Central |
| Competency state | Not identified as primary object | Central |
| Attestation | Present as adjacent infrastructure/pattern | Output of verified state |

---

# 10. Conclusion

The public Colosseum material reviewed shows a **populated adjacent landscape**, not an empty one.

Existing projects demonstrate prior exploration of:

- credentials;
- verified professionals;
- talent matching;
- skills;
- achievements;
- performance verification.

The benchmark did **not** identify, in the public descriptions reviewed, a project explicitly combining:

> **evidence of work → independent verification → consensus → competency state → attestation**

as its central workflow.

This is the current research finding.

It remains a **differentiation hypothesis**, not proof of market uniqueness or commercial validation.

# 11. Research limitations

1. Public project descriptions are not technical implementation audits.
2. A hackathon submission does not establish market traction.
3. Feature overlap does not establish architectural equivalence.
4. Absence from public search does not prove non-existence.
5. Some projects may have evolved after their hackathon submission.
6. Public descriptions may omit technical mechanisms.
7. The benchmark does not establish customer demand or willingness to pay.

---

# 12. Open research questions

1. Are there private or poorly indexed Colosseum projects with stronger overlap?
2. Which of the closest projects evolved into active products?
3. Which have real users or measurable traction?
4. What verification mechanisms do the closest projects actually use?
5. Do any use multiple independent assessors or mechanisms?
6. Does any existing project model competency as an explicit state?
7. What evidence do existing verified-talent products require?
8. What parts of this problem are already served by non-Colosseum products?

These questions belong to subsequent research rather than being resolved by assumption.

# 14. Evidence discipline

Future updates to this document must preserve:

- source;
- date;
- project;
- observed overlap;
- evidence strength;
- uncertainty;
- research implication.

The document must continue to distinguish:

**Observed project evidence ≠ inference ≠ product claim.**

---

## Status

**Initial public ecosystem benchmark completed.**

**Adjacent overlap:** confirmed.

**Direct architectural equivalent identified:** not in the public material reviewed.

**Differentiation:** hypothesis requiring further validation.
