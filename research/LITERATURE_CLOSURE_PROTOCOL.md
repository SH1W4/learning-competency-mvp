# Literature Closure Protocol — Evidence to Competency Verification

**Status:** PROTOCOL FROZEN — screening ready
**Date:** 2026-10-04
**Review type:** Scoping / structured literature review
**Scope:** Observable work evidence → competency inference/state → verification → consensus → provenance → attestation

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines how the related-work corpus should be expanded and screened before the research gap is stated as an article-level finding.

The protocol exists to prevent confirmation bias: the search must actively seek evidence that contradicts the current LASTRO gap hypothesis.

The current repository matrix remains a scoped review until this protocol is executed against external academic databases with reproducible search records.

## 2. Primary research question

> How can observable work or performance evidence support defensible inference of a bounded competency state, and what mechanisms exist for independently verifying, aggregating, tracing and attesting that inference?

## 3. Secondary questions

- RQ1 — Evidence: What models explain the relationship between observable work/performance and competency claims?
- RQ2 — Aggregation: How are heterogeneous observations combined into competency judgments or longitudinal states?
- RQ3 — Computational inference: How are computational systems or AI used to interpret performance evidence?
- RQ4 — Independent verification: What mechanisms independently evaluate evidence, interpretations or assessment outputs?
- RQ5 — Consensus: How are disagreement, uncertainty and multiple assessment signals resolved?
- RQ6 — Provenance: How is evidence lineage represented and used in assessment or competency decisions?
- RQ7 — Attestation: How are competency claims or assessment outcomes represented as independently verifiable records?
- RQ8 — Composition: Are there existing systems or architectures that explicitly combine these layers in one end-to-end pipeline?

## 6. Target databases / indexes

Priority: Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC, PubMed/MEDLINE, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar.

Standards and infrastructure are searched separately: W3C, NIST, ISO/IEC where relevant, and major credential/provenance specifications.

Market/ecosystem sources remain a separate evidence class and must not be mixed into the academic screening count.

## 7. Inclusion criteria

Include a source when it: (1) concerns competency, competence, capability or a closely equivalent construct; (2) contains observable performance/work evidence, assessment evidence or an explicit inference mechanism; (3) provides conceptual, empirical or technical information relevant to at least one research question; (4) is sufficiently documented to extract methods and conclusions; and (5) has established publication date and provenance.

Technical standards and systems may be included for the composition question, but must be classified separately from academic publications.

## 8. Exclusion criteria

Exclude purely philosophical discussions without an assessment/inference mechanism; generic employee performance-management articles without competency inference; generic blockchain credential marketing; vendor material without technical documentation; papers where competency is only a keyword; duplicates; inaccessible sources where the relevant claim cannot be verified; and generic AI capability marketing.

## 9. Screening procedure

Stage 1 — title/abstract: INCLUDE, EXCLUDE, or UNCERTAIN.

Stage 2 — full text: INCLUDE — DIRECT; INCLUDE — ADJACENT; EXCLUDE — OUT OF SCOPE; EXCLUDE — INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.

Stage 3 — extract citation, domain, research design, context, evidence type, competency construct, inference model, observations, raters, aggregation, longitudinal component, computational/AI component, verification, disagreement handling, provenance, attestation, limitations, and relevance to RQ1–RQ8.

## 10. Counterexample rule

Flag GAP-THREAT when a source contains most of: real-world/work evidence; explicit competency inference; multiple independent verification mechanisms; explicit consensus; bounded competency state; provenance; cryptographic or machine-verifiable attestation; and an integrated end-to-end architecture.

If a GAP-THREAT source is found, the research gap must be rewritten before the article is drafted.

## 11. Evidence-strength classification

- HIGH — direct empirical or normative support from a primary source.
- MODERATE — multiple compatible sources or a strong secondary synthesis.
- LOW — single study, conceptual proposal or indirect analogy.
- HYPOTHESIS — proposed architecture or interpretation without sufficient external validation.

The LASTRO contribution must never be upgraded from HYPOTHESIS solely because multiple project documents repeat it.

## 12. Extraction matrix

| ID | Citation | Domain | Evidence | Competency claim | Evidence contract | Multi-source | Longitudinal | AI/computational | Verification | Consensus | Provenance | Attestation | State | Composition | Evidence strength | Gap impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Gap impact values: SUPPORTS GAP; WEAKENS GAP; NEUTRAL; GAP-THREAT.

## 13. Current search limitation

At protocol freeze, the available public web search interface did not return usable results for the targeted academic queries.

Therefore no fabricated search counts are reported; no PRISMA flow numbers are claimed; no database coverage is claimed as completed; the current related-work matrix remains a scoped review; and this protocol is ready for execution when reliable database retrieval is available.

## 14. Current evidence baseline

The existing corpus establishes strong prior art for evidence-centered assessment, workplace-based assessment, programmatic assessment, triangulation, longitudinal competency judgment, portfolio assessment, learning analytics, AI-assisted assessment, provenance, verifiable credentials, AI evaluation/TEVV, and distributed verification infrastructure.

The unresolved composition remains:

WORK → EVIDENCE → INTERPRETATION → INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION → CONSENSUS → BOUNDED COMPETENCY STATE → ATTESTATION

This remains a research hypothesis, not an established novelty claim.

## 15. Stop condition for the literature phase

The literature phase is closed only when: all primary search strings have been executed; duplicates removed; title/abstract screening complete; full-text screening complete; all GAP-THREAT candidates resolved; extraction is sufficient to answer RQ1–RQ8; the research-gap statement survives counterexample review; and the final included corpus is frozen.

## 16. Article transition

After closure, the article can state, with appropriate qualification, that the review identified established evidence-centered and competency-assessment foundations, adjacent verification/provenance infrastructures, and a remaining research gap concerning their explicit composition into an auditable competency-verification pipeline.
