# Related Work Matrix — Evidence to Competency Verification

**Status:** REVIEW MATRIX CLOSED — current scoped corpus
**Date:** 2026-10-04
**Purpose:** compare established literature, standards and adjacent systems against the LASTRO research pipeline.

This matrix is a scoped related-work analysis, not a systematic-review claim and not a legal novelty analysis. Its purpose is to determine whether the proposed composition has identifiable prior art at the level of individual mechanisms or as an integrated architecture.

## 1. Comparison dimensions

The corpus is evaluated against these dimensions:

1. observable work/performance;
2. explicit competency claim;
3. evidence contract;
4. evidence interpretation;
5. multiple evidence sources;
6. longitudinal state;
7. computational/AI interpretation;
8. independent verification;
9. explicit consensus/aggregation;
10. provenance;
11. cryptographic attestation;
12. bounded competency state;
13. full end-to-end composition.

Legend:

- **● Established / central**
- **○ Present / supporting**
- **△ Partial / adjacent**
- **— Not a material focus**
- **? Unresolved / requires further investigation**

## 3. Interpretation of the matrix

### 3.1 The first half of the pipeline is not novel

The literature already provides substantial foundations for:

WORK → EVIDENCE → COMPETENCY INFERENCE

This includes Evidence-Centered Design, workplace-based assessment, programmatic assessment, portfolios, triangulation, longitudinal competency judgment and learning analytics.

Therefore the article must not claim that LASTRO invented evidence-based competency inference.

### 3.2 The verification layer exists in neighboring disciplines

Independent verification, provenance and cryptographic integrity are not novel primitives.

They are strongly established in adjacent technical domains:

PROV → provenance

VC → verifiable claims

NIST TEVV → evaluation / verification / validation

oracles / proof systems / AVS → distributed verification

The research question therefore cannot be:

> Can digital claims be verified?

That has already been answered.

The relevant question is:

> What exactly should be independently verified in a competency inference pipeline, and how should those verification results affect the resulting bounded state?

### 3.3 Consensus is established as aggregation, but not necessarily as LASTRO's protocol

Programmatic assessment already provides strong precedent for:

multiple observations → aggregation → triangulation → competency judgment

This is a major constraint on any novelty claim.

The potentially differentiating research question is narrower:

> Can the aggregation/consensus layer be represented as an explicit, machine-auditable protocol whose inputs remain separately inspectable and whose output preserves insufficient evidence and conflict?

That is materially different from claiming that aggregation itself is new.

## 4. Strongest potential counterexamples

A serious paper must actively test the gap against the following categories.

### Counterexample A — competency portfolios

Portfolios already combine heterogeneous evidence and support competency judgments.

**Effect on LASTRO claim:** weakens any claim that heterogeneous evidence aggregation is novel.

**Surviving distinction:** explicit independent verification, machine-auditable consensus and cryptographically anchored state are not inherent to portfolio assessment.

### Counterexample B — programmatic assessment

Programmatic assessment already combines observations across methods, contexts, raters and time.

**Effect:** weakens any claim that longitudinal multi-signal competency state formation is novel.

**Surviving distinction:** the LASTRO hypothesis concerns explicit verification semantics and auditable state transition rather than merely assessment-program design.

### Counterexample C — verifiable credentials

W3C VC already defines issuer/holder/verifier relationships and cryptographically verifiable claims.

**Effect:** completely removes any novelty claim around verifiable competency credentials.

**Surviving distinction:** LASTRO places the research question upstream, at the evidence-to-state transformation.

### Counterexample D — provenance standards

W3C PROV already provides provenance semantics.

**Effect:** provenance cannot be presented as a LASTRO invention.

**Surviving distinction:** LASTRO investigates how provenance constrains a competency inference pipeline.

### Counterexample E — AI evaluation / TEVV

NIST and related AI evaluation research already establish test, evaluation, verification and validation concepts.

**Effect:** AI plus verification is not sufficient differentiation.

**Surviving distinction:** the semantic object being verified is a bounded competency inference derived from work evidence.

### Counterexample F — distributed verification

Oracles, AVSs, proof systems and dispute mechanisms already establish distributed verification patterns.

**Effect:** distributed verification is not novel.

**Surviving distinction:** external verification infrastructure does not automatically define competency semantics or the competency-state transition.

## 5. Composition matrix

The strongest way to state the research gap is to compare layers, not buzzwords.

| Layer | Existing prior art? | LASTRO research question |
|---|---|---|
| Observable work as evidence | Yes | How should work be bounded by an evidence contract? |
| Evidence-centered competency claim | Yes | How should criteria map to observable evidence? |
| Heterogeneous evidence aggregation | Yes | How should heterogeneous signals remain inspectable? |
| Longitudinal competency state | Yes | What bounded state semantics are appropriate? |
| AI interpretation | Increasingly yes | What role can AI safely play? |
| Independent verification | Yes in adjacent domains; less standardized in competency assessment | What should be independently verified? |
| Explicit machine-auditable consensus | Aggregation is established; exact protocol is less established | Can verification results be resolved without hiding uncertainty/conflict? |
| Provenance-bound inference | Provenance is established; competency application varies | Can provenance constrain and audit the inference chain? |
| Cryptographic attestation | Yes | Can the resulting state be anchored without confusing integrity with validity? |
| Complete composition | **Not established by this scoped review** | **Core hypothesis** |

## 6. The actual gap

The matrix supports a much narrower statement than "there is no prior art":

> The individual components of LASTRO's architecture have substantial prior art across assessment science, AI evaluation, provenance and verifiable-credential infrastructure. The unresolved research question is the composition of these components into a competency-specific pipeline in which evidence interpretation, independent verification, consensus/state formation, provenance and post-decision attestation remain explicitly separated and auditable.

This is the strongest statement currently supported by the review.

## 7. What the matrix rules out

The following claims should be prohibited in the paper:

- LASTRO is the first competency verification system.
- No one has converted work evidence into competency.
- Blockchain verifies competency.
- Two AI models prove competency.
- Consensus proves truth.
- Provenance proves competency.
- Verifiable credentials solve competency assessment.
- LASTRO has no prior art.
- The architecture is patent-novel.

The paper can instead state:

- established components exist;
- their boundaries are often treated separately;
- the proposed composition is a research hypothesis;
- empirical validation is required.

## 8. Article-level contribution candidates

After closing this matrix, there are three plausible contribution levels.

### Contribution A — conceptual

A taxonomy separating:

evidence validity → interpretation → verification → consensus → state → attestation.

This is the safest contribution.

### Contribution B — architectural

A reference architecture for composing those layers around bounded competency claims.

This is stronger, but must be presented as a proposal rather than validated fact.

### Contribution C — empirical

An experiment comparing:

- AI-only interpretation;
- single-verifier assessment;
- multi-verifier consensus;
- human adjudication;
- provenance/attestation-enabled auditability.

This would provide the strongest scientific contribution, but requires actual experiments and data.

## 9. Final related-work verdict

### Established

- Work/performance evidence can support competency inference.
- Evidence-centered assessment provides an inferential foundation.
- Multiple observations and triangulation improve competency judgment.
- Longitudinal assessment can represent competency development.
- Computational and AI-assisted assessment exists.
- Provenance is standardized.
- Verifiable credentials are standardized.
- Cryptographic integrity and verification are established.
- AI evaluation and verification frameworks exist.

### Partially established / adjacent

- Independent verification specifically for competency inference.
- Machine-auditable consensus between heterogeneous verification mechanisms.
- Provenance as an explicit constraint on competency-state inference.
- Cryptographic attestation integrated downstream of competency-state formation.

### Not established by this review

The following complete composition was not identified in the scoped corpus:

WORK
→ EVIDENCE
→ INTERPRETATION
→ INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION
→ CONSENSUS
→ BOUNDED COMPETENCY STATE
→ ATTESTATION

This is therefore the current research hypothesis, not a proven novelty claim.

## 10. Methodological caution

This matrix should be described in the article as the result of a scoped literature and prior-art review, unless the corpus is subsequently expanded using a formal database search protocol with documented inclusion/exclusion criteria.

It should not be called a systematic review solely because the comparison is structured.

## 11. Next research step

Before drafting the final article, the remaining high-value task is empirical literature closure:

1. define inclusion/exclusion criteria;
2. search academic databases systematically;
3. record candidate studies;
4. screen titles/abstracts;
5. extract full-text evidence;
6. add possible counterexamples to this matrix;
7. document exclusions;
8. produce a PRISMA-style search/screening record where applicable;
9. freeze the related-work corpus;
10. only then write the article's research-gap and contribution sections.

That prevents the article from making a gap claim based only on papers we already expected to find.
